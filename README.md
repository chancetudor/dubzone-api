**I am currently working on a complete overhaul and will host using GCP.**

## Notes

Inspired by Derek Sivers' post ["Why You Need a Database,"](https://sive.rs/dbt) I set out to create a database and an API to access the database. 

I didn't know what data to hold and expose until I realized that information about weapons and loadouts for Call of Duty Warzone would be a perfect candidate, as such information is only currently accessible in a multitude of YouTube videos.

I built this in Go to further develop my knowledge of the language, and used MongoDB to gain further experience in NoSQL schemas.

_This is a personal project, and so is not currently operational for real-world usage._ Feel free to take a look at my code to see my design choices and code quality, though!
